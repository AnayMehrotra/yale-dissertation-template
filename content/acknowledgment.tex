\chapter*{Acknowledgment} 

First and foremost, I am eternally grateful to my academic advisor, Peter Salovey.
In addition to the countless hours of stimulating discussion, the sweet bluegrass sounds of his bass have inspired many of the results in this dissertation.
For this and more, I offer my sincerest thanks.

Thank you to my many collaborators from whom I have learned so much.
In particular, Clifford the Big Red Dog and Airbud who have been by side at the whiteboard for all these years.
The work appearing in this dissertation would not be possible without the bones we've shared together.
I thank those dogs who came before me, Lassie and Wishbone, for paving the way in this field.

Finally, thank you to my dearest family for their undying love: my mother, my father, and my 9 siblings in the litter.
Your continued support and playtime has been the greatest gift of all.
